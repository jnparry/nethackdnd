        <blockquote>"In a field 
            I am the absence
            of field.
            This is
            always the case.
            Wherever I am
            I am what is missing.

            When I walk
            I part the air
            and always
            the air moves in   
            to fill the spaces
            where my bodyâ€™s been.

            We all have reasons
            for moving.
            I move
            to keep things whole." - Mark Strand
